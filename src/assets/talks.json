      "description": "As an architectural engineer by training, and working as a web dev for the past couple of years, Katerina will explain how architecture has defined the way she designs web apps and pages and how Angular has supported her in organising content. A web page for me is like the facade of a house. From day one into web development, I looked at apps as if setting down plans for a new building. The process, like the process of building from the ground an establishment. I want to talk about scaffolding. I want to extend on designing the building blocks, the bricks made out of components. And as the construction is evolving, how materials fill in the empty spaces, making them consistent.",

      "description": "Maps, today, are an essential of the internet. Think of any app, and you will realize that it uses a map either to just display a location, or visualize data. Most of these apps, however, also use that map as a user interface, where the user can enter their location and receive corresponding, location based services or suggestions. Take for example car services apps (Uber, Beat), dating apps (Tinder), search-and-discovery apps (Foursquare), or any social app (Facebook, Twitter). In this presentation we will see how to create an Angular app that uses the Google Maps JS API and Firebase to match users together according to their chosen location! We will learn about Angular integration with Google Maps, user input on Google Maps and Angular and data display on Google Maps (the user generated data). The presentation will be interactive and engaging, since participants will be prompted to input their location and see the results live on the big screen. We will see code and examples and discuss implementation techniques.",

They will walk along a journey of developing an app with Angular and the real-time magic of Firebase, using the angularfire2 library. Firebase acts as a backend as a service and takes care of real time synchronization across apps and platforms. The participants will learn about and use the main Firebase modules needed to develop a simple social application. They will use Authentication, cloud storage and the Real-Time database. Best practices about application planning will be discussed, like structuring the data in the API and decisions that need to be made in advance. At the end of this workshop, each participant will have created and deployed a simple web application. The workshop needs prior knowledge of web development. Some basic Angular experience is preferable, but not essential. No prior knowledge of Firebase is needed. The users will need a web-development-friendly laptop (preferably a Unix-based system, or Windows with nodejs and npm installed).",

They will walk along a journey of developing an app with Angular and the real-time magic of Firebase, using the angularfire2 library. Firebase acts as a backend as a service and takes care of real time synchronization across apps and platforms. The participants will learn about and use the main Firebase modules needed to develop a simple social application. They will use Authentication, cloud storage and the Real-Time database. Best practices about application planning will be discussed, like structuring the data in the API and decisions that need to be made in advance. At the end of this workshop, each participant will have created and deployed a simple web application. The workshop needs prior knowledge of web development. Some basic Angular experience is preferable, but not essential. No prior knowledge of Firebase is needed. The users will need a web-development-friendly laptop (preferably a Unix-based system, or Windows with nodejs and npm installed).",

      "description": "This is the question that will be whispered among the audience during the talk. Using Angular, we will explore the possibilities of the Google Maps Platform and the Google Maps JS API. If you think of any app today, chances are it's using some kind of map. Your app has users, your users have a location, your services are based on that. Still, we find it worrisome to just add that customized, branded, interactive map in our app, because it just might seem too complicated. And we resort to out of the box solutions. Well, good news. The Google Maps JS API is here for you (and it’s been here for the last 15 years, despite you not making the most of it). Today we’ll see how simple it is to add that desired map to your business, brand it to your needs, and go advanced all the way, with this one weird trick that will make leaflet users hate you.",
